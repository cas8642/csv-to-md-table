This is a lightweight, browser-based tool that converts CSV (Comma-Separated Values) data into Markdown-formatted tables in real-time. It's designed for users who need to quickly transform CSV data for use in Markdown-supporting platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or various content management systems.

## Features

- Option to exclude empty columns: Remove columns where all data rows are empty or contain only whitespace
- Easy to use: No installation required, works directly in the browser
- Copy-friendly output: Results are displayed in a textarea for easy copying

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser
2. Paste or type your CSV data into the input textarea
3. The Markdown table will be generated automatically in the output textarea
4. Use the checkbox to toggle the exclusion of empty columns
5. Copy the resulting Markdown table from the output textarea

## Implementation

This tool is implemented using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no external dependencies. It runs entirely in the browser, ensuring privacy and ease of use.
